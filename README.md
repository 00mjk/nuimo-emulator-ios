## How to use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Xcode project (requires Xcode 7.2+)
3. Install the iOS app on your iOS device (requires iOS 8.0+)
4. Enable bluetooth to start advertising and allow for connections (= Nuimo power on)
5. Disable bluetooth to stop advertising and disconnect (= Nuimo power off)

## Notes

- Unlike Nuimo, the emulator continues to advertise when it is connected to a central device
- Restarting the app does not disconnect central devices until you actually disable bluetooth
